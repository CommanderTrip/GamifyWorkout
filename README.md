# GamifyWorkout

Little project to practice Rust programming and build an app that gamifies/tracks my workouts. I am following _Hybrid Calisthenics_'s routine defined in his [book](https://shop.hybridcalisthenics.com/collections/books/products/hybrid-calisthenics-book). The application needs to track my routine and determine where in the routine I am, all possible progressions of each movements and their levels, save progress history in CSV format, maintain records; goals; and rules, and finally any statistics would be nice too.
